### Rummikub Elo Ratings
2019-07-20: When I interned at Bapul--a startup which, unfortunately, no longer exists--my teammates and I used to play [Rummikub](https://www.rummikub.com/). As a data enthusiast, I used to record every single result and rank everyone by percentage won using Google Sheets. Then today, all of a sudden, I felt like using [the Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) to rank me and my ex-teammates. (I wasn't aware of it roughly four years ago.) So I exported the data to a csv file and coded up a script to get the Elo ratings of me and my teammates. I chose Python because I haven't tried static type hinting in Python. (Guess what? It feels so weird to see it in Python, but I love it!) 

IDE Used: PyCharm
